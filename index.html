  <h2><em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>, by Lewis Carroll</h2>

  <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
    conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"</p>

  <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up getting up and
    picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

  <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit actually took a
    watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
    watch to take out of it, and, buring with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!</p>

  <h2><em>Peter Pan</em>, by J.M. Barrie</h2>

  <p>All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden and she plucked another
    flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather deligtful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that
    passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.</p>
